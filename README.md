## [W-I-P] This repo was made to analyze my reading habits and allow other readers do the same 


### Statistics

Data: The data was stripped from my GoodReads account consisting of the books I read in 2020. It's enriched by genre information from the GoodReads API

Goal: Generate a graph that can visualize the connections between the books I'm reading and create a recommendation system for book. Additionally, I want to diversify my book selection both in genre and in demographics of the authors and the characters, so I'm using this project as an evaluator for diversity. 

Tech: Python (Pandas, GoodReads API, XML Parser)

Progress: Importing, filtering, and cleaned data

### Website

While I made this project selfishly, I think a lot of people who use GoodReads religiously and like to read would appreciate a tool to analyze their reading habits and show visualizations and recommendations of their reading landscape so beginning of the website also here

Tech: React with Atomize React UI Framework powered by Styletron Engine, Node JS backend
